3,54,I bought this laptop Was the worst Laptop I've ever bought. I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare. And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare. I sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it. They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work. And that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed. Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop. So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it...,LAPTOP#GENERAL,negative

I have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box! My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program. It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived. It took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem. Then just the other day, my left ""mouse"" button snapped! Being only 2 months old, I am not a happy camper! Buyer Beware. this one, in my opinion, might be a lemon!",LAPTOP#GENERAL,negative

I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed. Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them. It's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them. And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory stick they recomended). Long story short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in. Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba? Probably not ever again. I'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba. Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product.",LAPTOP#QUALITY,negative

I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!). Finally, I should note that I took the 2GB RAM stick from my old EeePC and installed it before I even powered on for the first time.

103,32,"I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly dissatisfied with it. The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning. It freezes, and it always shows that there is an error, so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it. I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem. Well, I started using Google Chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes. This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don't save your files and information, everything will be lost. Another issue I have with it is the battery. Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden. There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when I click on it it says: "" Consider replacing your battery"" and it does not hold full charge. It is not even a year old yet, so I would definitely not recommend it to anyone. Don't waste your money!",LAPTOP#GENERAL,negative

137,93,This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it! I purchased this laptop 9 months ago! The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD'd during that time! They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later. I am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when I got back in town. If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before! I spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person! Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up! I can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase! Breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4+ people to report the damaged part will be returned late! I do not recommend this company or their products!!!!,OPTICAL_DRIVES#QUALITY,negative

For those that care about noise this thing doesn't really make any; the i3 processor doesn't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on.

I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff.

160,42,Me and my boyfriend bought the Gateway NV78 in nov of 09. Bought with a credit card. Probbly the worst decision we ever made! It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard! the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one. the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon! pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were. i love the size of the computer since i play games on it. i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have. also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard. So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer,LAPTOP#GENERAL,negative

161,134,I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty. The computer was shipped to their repair depot  on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned. I called their repair depot as was told they would send Me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot. They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place. The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba. The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue. Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air? to Louisville Ky. By Air sounds more like by truck to Me. And Toshiba is totally unconcerned. The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter. We don't Mind and You don't Matter. I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter.

It's exactly like the picture and I AM SATISFIED.",LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS,positive

Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly. Also, I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.

When the computer has been on for several minutes, it will occasionaly just go off by itself. Also, the battery does not last very long at all. I would recommend not buying this product. I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem. I am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with. Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly. Also, I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines. It gets stuck all of the time you use it, and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work. Sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer. Will probably never buy a HP again.",KEYBOARD#USABILITY,negative

200,130,bought notebook 07/2009. in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse. 1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in. returned it. 5 months dead again. They say sorry out of warranty. Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period. Now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine. They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything. Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.

201,384,I've haven't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off.

I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased. So I'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority. The only thing I didn't learn in my research was the software I would need like privacy protection and warranty protection, in case it gets broken, or crashes etc. I don't have that additional money right now, and therefore wouldn't have purchased it at this time. Those things are very important - vital even! So think about factoring those things in when you purchase. I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I won't have to worry about a crash.

I bought it simply for Excel on Windows for work since I have a Macbook Air and literally the thing freezes and lags opening Excel or my web browser. There is a chance mine is defective but regardless I'm not going to try another one this is a terrible product. I'd much rather bite the bullet and spend a little more for a product that actually meets minimum computing expectations for 2014.

Machine gets fairly hot near the bottom of the screen. 5.Best to use the power supply for 4K video viewing. Battery power laptop had difficulties computing. 6.Still feels too heavy to me.

The pictures are clear as can be. If I had to buy another computer, I would most definetly buy an acer one computer. Heck, if I had enough ' money, I would but it as a gift for someone. Im glad that it has such great features in it. It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home. Clear picture on it and everything. The one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here, it tends to freeze up sometimes, but thats the only bad thing about this computer.

273,374,I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied. The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones. Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it. That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed. It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back. ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke. I babyed the heck out of it and i still do. To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk. The graphics are great. The internet speed is spectacular. The battery life is probably an hour at best. Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good. I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.

I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.,BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,negative
273,374,I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied. The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones. Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it. That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed. It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back. ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke. I babyed the heck out of it and i still do. To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk. The graphics are great. The internet speed is spectacular. The battery life is probably an hour at best.

For $250, which is as much as my graphics card alone cost, this laptop is an incredible value. It is quite impressive at multitasking, which really surprised me. I can have tabs open while playing YouTube videos and it handles it impressively well. BUT I should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen, it's certainly good enough for the average person, but if you're used to good screens this may bother you a bit, but it's certainly not unbearable by anyone's standards.

I hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would. It is absolutely horrible to use, despite all its so called advanced features. I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use. Buy this if you like being tortured, teased, frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac.

Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything, so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient. I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college. I use the computer to basically check emails, surf the web, print coupons and for my college papers. I was getting extrememly frustrated when I would want to do these simple taks that I would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my PC. It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow. My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and ordered my Apple. Yes, I thought the expese was a little much, but I now realize you get what you pay for. I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use. I've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful, english speaking (from Vancouver) techs that walked me through the processes to help me. I can't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket. Money and time well spent! Highly recommended!",SUPPORT#QUALITY,positive
301,92,"With today's company fighting over marketshare, its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone. I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION. Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working. Call tech support, standard email the form and fax it back in to us. I called back to ensure that received it, they had. But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!! Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time. This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped. Asked the customer service rep. If it's not shipped on the next business day, called on a Friday they are closed on weekends, what was the next step. The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question. Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site. I'm tired of the inept service. If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS!!! Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small. I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE. HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK!!! I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter, so it's not just an isolated incident!!!",SUPPORT#QUALITY,negative

302,52,"I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market. I also bought one for my wife, and 3 for my office. They are wonderful, but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat. I burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so I can place it there. I had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times. This is what they told me: It heats up, and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops, and simply categorize them as portables. You might think, I am new in this game, but I am a gadget lover, and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years, and none gets this hot, that fast. I also experience the same with my MacBook Air. So you might ask, what did Apple do for me? For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this). Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby. The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.

It's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box. If you want a little more custom ability, drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more. (I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $50) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours, or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents. My ONLY issues are: the screen/video resolution won't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60 That being said, it still runs video in full screen decently. The sound is a bit quiet if you're on a plane, this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones.

It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer. It has a lot of memory and a great battery life. It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed. Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes. Iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites. The internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily.,LAPTOP#GENERAL,positive

Being a PC user my whole life, it's taking a bit of time to adapt to the OS of a Mac but I'm finding my way around. The unibody design is edgy and durable. The LED backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more. I'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages. Granted, it's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops, my Mac boots up noticeably quicker. A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect. They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular.

I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me. None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing. They would repair one thing, send it back and it would still have the same problem. The processor went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went. I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble. I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty. I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty. I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT. I waited and waited and no laptop. Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box. I waited another month for approval and for them to ""BUILD"" me a new laptop. I was psyched. I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn't go onto our wireless network and I wouldn't have the same problems because it was updated. Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing. HP didn't fix it. I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.

It was very easy to just pick up and use-- It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS. (I had been a Windows/Linux user before this) I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for (Internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable. There are several programs for school or office use (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc.), music (Garageband), photo management (Photo Booth, iPhoto), video-editing or movie-making (iMovie), etc. The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services. iTunes is a handy music-management program, and it is essential for anyone with an iPod. The neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons. All-in-all, I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone.",LAPTOP#GENERAL,positive

There are several programs for school or office use (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc.), music (Garageband), photo management (Photo Booth, iPhoto), video-editing or movie-making (iMovie), etc. The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services. iTunes is a handy music-management program, and it is essential for anyone with an iPod.

360,41,"I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated, but once you get past the initial expense you'll find that they're worth every penny (besides, there's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers). The 13"" MacBook Pro is portable, durable, and very capable. It has a 10 hour battery life when you're doing web browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours. It's also very energy efficient, running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb.

373,164,"I got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it. It was a hard decision for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing. But to be honest, I don't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming. So this was great for me. It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs. Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work. I also travel with it and it never gives me any problems. It was also cheaper than the Pro which made it even more appealing to me. Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook, I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros. But I am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it. I look forward to years of use, it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well.",LAPTOP#GENERAL,positive

It doesn't bother me though. It doesn't heat up like my old laptop. All for such a great price. It's color is even cool. Another Great thing is the Beast graphics. They are so realistic I am just speechless. I let my friend borrow it, and she knows nothing about computers, and she used it with ease. The cool thing about this is anyone can use it.

The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick, but it is still a great notebook! The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile. I love it! I even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more! We are addicted to the Mac.

I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop. Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone. So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message. I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it, I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use. Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook. Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.",LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,neutral

The reviews at the time in late July 2014 were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost 4 star review... The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus. Now the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic (medium low grade) plastic. So if you don't have kids, or not in high school or don't accidently sit on it, it should be fine. Now the speed is disappointing. Start up is fine  maybe 20 secs at most, but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times. Even for a 4GB RAM it barely chugs with 3 tabs open. I tried all the Window updates (this worked for a couple of HP laptops I7in that I bought later at BB) to see if it could remove the drag, it did not. Really at this point I am trying to confirm if the RAM can be upgraded to see if I can do that to help. Couple that with lack of inbuilt Bluetooth, dvd drive you are looking at a close tie (or even a loss) compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late August 2014. The HP laptops 17in (with i3 core and AMD) I mentioned before from the other big electronic BB store smoked this one even before I updated windows and upped the RAM. But alas they were gifts...and what is a gift if not given? All in all I wish I had waited a bit. But then again hindsight is 20/20.

383,391,"Let me start with the good:So awesome. Great OS, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port. This is my second MacBook. The first one I had was a 2006 model, not the Pro. I fell in love with it. This one has had the same effect. I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion, so I kind of knew what I was getting, but hadn't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features. The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive. The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior. The Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful. It is everything I'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy. For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy. It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook. The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me (I prefer it dark) or if you can crank up the brightness. My real problem with it? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie. I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it. The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours. Enabling the battery timer is useless. The ""Time remaining"" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes. It's a joke. It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something. I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like. This ain't it. My only other complaint is that it gets really hot.:-) If you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.",LAPTOP#GENERAL,positive

385,39,"I've had my Macbook Pro since August 2009. Prior to this computer, I owned a PowerBook G4 for 6 years (quite a long time for a laptop). That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought. My MacBook Pro is no exception. On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I didn't like the trackpad. Since I've had this computer I've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth. I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad. The display is incredibly bright, much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp. The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well.

Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings). I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home, and it runs just fine. I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive. The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16"" laptop does. I wouldn't play a first-person shooter with this, mind, but if you wanted to run MS Office, email, chat, download a video, listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store, and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in, I'd highly recommend checking this out. The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week. Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.",LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,positive

388,29,"The Macbook is a fantastic laptop. This is the first macbook I have ever had. I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop. The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance. Although the price is higher then Dell laptops, the Macbooks are worth the dough. You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it. The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot. It just works flawlessly!

I can actually get work done with this MAC, and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop. The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great (I even put it to the test by accident)- excellent innovation! The Apple applications (ex.iPhoto) are fun, easy, and really cool to use (unlike the competition)! After doing CAD work all day at work, using a higher end PC, I couldn't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer. This laptop rocks (only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple doesn't support)! I've saved a lot of time and headaches so far, using my new MacBook Pro.

390,380,"I've had this laptop for about a month now. It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part. The 2 GB of RAM is plenty, able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown. The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft. My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in. This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range. Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.",LAPTOP#GENERAL,positive

And of course, the return window closed last week so now, I'm stuck with it. I will never buy another Lenovo anything! Unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop, don't buy this. The touchpad hasn't worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning, I thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads I've worked with have some inherent oddities. This one however, is now very loose and I have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work, Then suddenly, I can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own. Today, it hasn't worked at all more than it has. The laptop has 4G and a 2.9g processor and it's slower than the four year old Toshiba I replaced. It hangs, freezes and just isn't working properly. I have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open! Though I don't have much installed, I only have 96 of the 278G left! I have no idea what's taking up all the room, it doesn't make sense. Most of my things are stored in the cloud.

The touchpad hasn't worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning, I thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads I've worked with have some inherent oddities. This one however, is now very loose and I have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work, Then suddenly, I can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own. Today, it hasn't worked at all more than it has. The laptop has 4G and a 2.9g processor and it's slower than the four year old Toshiba I replaced. It hangs, freezes and just isn't working properly.
